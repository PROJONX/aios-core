B) "What If Your Entire Life Could Shift in Just 8 Frequencies?"

## HERO CTA

```

### Problem Section (Agitate)

```markdown
## "Something Is Missing..."

You've read the books. Done the meditations. Tried the apps.

Yet every morning, you wake up feeling...
- Disconnected from your deeper purpose
- Stuck in patterns you can't break
- Exhausted by a life that should be fulfilling
- Searching for something you can't quite name

**The truth is:** Traditional approaches are missing a critical element.

They focus on the mind. But transformation happens at a deeper level.

**At the level of frequency.**
```

### Solution Section

```markdown
## Introducing The Frequency Path™

A revolutionary 8-phase journey that uses the science of frequency alignment to create lasting transformation.

This isn't meditation. It's not visualization. It's not positive thinking.

**It's the systematic activation of your consciousness through calibrated frequencies.**

Each phase builds on the last:
1. **Awakening** (396 Hz) — Release what holds you back
2. **Clarity** (417 Hz) — See your path with precision
3. **Alignment** (528 Hz) — Harmonize with your purpose
[Continue for all 8 phases...]
```

### Benefits Bullets

```markdown
## What You'll Experience

✦ **Finally feel that "something" you've been searching for** — the deep connection to purpose that makes every day meaningful

✦ **Wake up with genuine excitement** instead of the familiar heaviness that used to greet you

✦ **Break free from years-old patterns** that have kept you small, stuck, and frustrated

✦ **Access states of consciousness** previously reserved for monks with decades of practice

```
